## [Tell Me About Yourself | Best Answer (from former CEO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHW7gGjrCQ)
I originally did not give this question a lot of thought or at least not the thought that it was deserved. What does someone mean when they ask you to "Tell me about yourself"? The phase could be interpreted in a million different ways and answered in a million more. Understanding this phrase now from an interview perspect, it is tantamount to "briefly take me through your resume". Taking some inspirationg from "Tell Me About Yourself | Best Answer (from former CEO)" from the youtube channel The Companies Expert my best answer would be along the lines of this: <br>  Well, as you can see from my resume, I have always tried to be a leader in my community. I started my time at college as a member of hall government and then became a resident mentor. While I was in college, I interned at Nephron during the summers until covid happened. I have been a part of multiple groups working on projects. I am used to working in a team and being in different roles. I am a new grad from USC. And that's what brings me here today and why I am excited to hear more about this oppurtunity.
