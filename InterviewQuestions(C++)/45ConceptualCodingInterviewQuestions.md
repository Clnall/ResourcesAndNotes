# Conceptual Coding Interview Questions
### 21.) What is a data structure? <br>
A data structure is a storing and managing construct of data where there is a relationship between the data.
### 22.) What is an array? <br>
An array is a collection of elements of the same size or data type at contiguous memory locations.
### 23.) What is a linked list? <br>
A linked list is a data structure built with nodes comprised of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. A head pointer indicates the start of a linked list and the end is signified by a pointer to NULL.
### 24.) What is the difference between an array and a linked list? <br>
The difference between an array and a linked list is an array has contiguous memory locations while linked list has noncontiguous memory locations. An array uses less memory than a linked list given an array does not need to store information of where the next element is. 

In an array the data can be accessed by index while a linked list needs to be iterated through.

Resizing a linked list is less involved than an array. 
Resizing a linked list is attaching the previous node's pointer to the new node and the new node's pointer to the next node or if there is not a next node to NULL. 
Resizing an array involves creating a new array of the appropiate size and copying the old array into it then adding the new data.

### 25.) What is LIFO? <br>
Last In First Out. Example Stack
### 26.) What is FIFO? <br>
First In First Out. Example Queue
### 27.) What is a stack? <br>
A stack is a data structure with two operations push and pop only executable at the end of the list.
### 28.) What are binary trees? <br>

### 29.) What are binary search trees? <br>

### 30.) What is object-oriented programming? <br>

### 31.) What is the purpose of a loop in programming? <br>
The purpose of loops in programming is to repeat a block of code some amount of times depending on the conditional statement.
### 32.) What is a conditional statement? <br>
A conditional statement is a statement that can be evaluate as true or false.
### 33.) What is debugging? <br>
Debugging is the process of finding and correcting errors in code. Examples of some errors could be in syntax, scope, or function.
### 34.) What is recursion? <br>
A class that calls itself with a break condition.
### 35.) What are the differences between linear and non-linear data structures? <br>
The difference between a linear and non-linear data structure is that a linear data strucutre can only have at most one element before and after another element hence linear while non-linear can have more that one element before or after another element. Examples of linear data structure are linked lists, arrays, queues, and stacks. Examples of non-linear data structures are binary trees and graphs.
