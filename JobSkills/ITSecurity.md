- Roles: technical security manager vs program security manager
  - technical security manager is responsible for security systems: firewalls, data protection controls, patching, encryption, vulnerability scanning, pen testing, etc.
  - program security manager is responsible for cyber risk mitigation
 - Key Responsibilities:
   1. Monitor all operations and infastructure
   2. Maintain all security tools and technology
   3. Monitor internal and external policy compliance
   4. Monitor regulation compliance
   5. Work with different departments in the organization to reduce risk
   6. Implement new technology
   7. Audit policies and controls continuously
   8. Ensure cybersecurity stays on the organizational radar

- Risk remediation is the act of preventing an identified vulnerability
  - solving unpatched systems or misconfigured software
- Risk mitigation is the act of reducing the risk of threats instead of eliminating the threat altogether
  - keeping risks from spreading or minimizing the amount of data that gets stolen
- How to improve risk remediation and mitigation
  1. Understand your organization's attack surface
  2. Continuously monitor for emerging risk
  3. Model risk scenarios and paths to remediation
  4. Address supply chain risk

[Types of Cyber Attacks](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/types-of-cyber-attacks)
1. DoS and DDoS Attacks
   - (Distributed) Denial-of-Service is an attack to overwhelm the resources of a system to the point of not being able to service legitimate requests. Distributed DoS is similar but uses an array of malware-infected machines.
   - Prevention: Utilizing a firewall to determine legitimate requests.
2. MITM Attacks
   - Man-in-the-Middle is an attack where an attacker positions themselves between the sending and receiving parties. The attacker can modify or access the message before it reaches its destination.
   - Prevention: Strong encryption on access points or using a (VPN) virtual private network.
4. Phishing Attacks
   - An attack where the attacker sends emails that seem to be coming from a trusted, legitimate sources in an attempt to get sensitive information from the target.
   - Prevention: Awareness and checking "Reply-to" and "Return-path" parameters to match the same domain present in the email.
6. Whale-phising Attacks
   - Similar to Phishing Attacks but more specific targets and high value targets such as those in C-suite or others in charge of the organization.
   - Prevention: Examining emails, not clicking on suspicious attachments or links, and looking for suspicious destinations or parameters.
8. Spear-phishing Attacks
   - Similar to Phishing Attacks but the attacker researches the target and writes a more personally relevant message. This attack often uses email spoofing where the from portion of the email is faked and website cloning to lull the target into a sense of comfort as to entering private information in the faked website.
   - Prevention: Carefully check all details in the email fields and not clicking any link that can not be verified as legitimate.
10. Ransomware
    - An attack where the victim's system is held hostage until they pay a ransom to the attacker. 
12. Password Attack
13. SQL Injection Attack
14. URL Interpretation
15. DNS Spoofing
16. Session Hijacking
17. Brute Force Attack
18. Web Attacks
19. Insider Threats
20. Trojan Horses
21. Drive-by Attacks
22. XSS Attacks
23. Eavesdropping Attacks
24. Birthday Attack
25. Malware Attack
